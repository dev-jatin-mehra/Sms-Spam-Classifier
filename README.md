# Spam Mail/SMS Detection using Machine Learning with Streamlit

![Spam Detection](./image/Screenshot%20(207).png)

## Overview

This project implements a spam mail/SMS detection system using Machine Learning techniques and Streamlit for visualization and deployment. The goal is to accurately classify incoming messages as either spam or legitimate (ham).

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering and cleaning a diverse dataset of emails and SMS messages.
  
- **Model Selection**: Experimenting with various ML algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and Neural Networks.
  
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating features such as word frequencies and message length.
  
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
  
- **Deployment**: Setting up the model for real-time detection using Streamlit.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit
